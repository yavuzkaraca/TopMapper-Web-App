  <h1>About TopMapper</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>TopMapper</strong> is a web-based simulation tool designed to model retinotectal projections and axon guidance mechanisms during neural development. Evolving from its original Python-based backend, Top Mapper now offers an interactive and accessible interface for researchers to simulate and visualize complex biological processes in real time.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Our mission is to provide researchers with an intuitive platform to explore the mechanisms behind axon guidance and topographic mapping. By leveraging web-based technologies, Top Mapper allows users to easily configure simulations, visualize results, and experiment with various biological models without needing extensive programming knowledge.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Web-Based Accessibility:</strong> The transition from a Python-only app to a web application ensures that researchers can now run simulations directly in their browsers with no need for local installations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Customizable Simulations:</strong> TopMapper allows users to adjust parameters such as growth cone size, movement probabilities, and substrate types, offering flexibility to model different biological systems.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advanced Visualization:</strong> The platform includes integrated visualization tools that display the progression of growth cone movements and projection mappings, allowing users to analyze simulation results effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessible Source Code:</strong> Users can explore the underlying source code and algorithms through the <strong>Source Code</strong> tab, promoting transparency and collaboration.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    To begin exploring TopMapper, navigate to the <strong>Simulation</strong> tab. Here, you can configure the parameters for your simulation and run it in real time. Once the simulation completes, the results will be visualized in a detailed and interactive format, allowing you to adjust parameters and rerun as needed.
